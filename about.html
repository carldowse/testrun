    <title>About Carl Dowse</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I’m currently employed full-time at a business college in Germany, where I’m responsible for business-related English courses on the undergraduate programmes. Before this, I had a similar position in Milan, Italy.</p>
    <p>Some years ago I founded and ran my own business – a British Council accredited private language school based in England – so I’ve also had some experience of running a company. And I also train corporate clients, usually on a one-to-one basis, when invited to so.</p>
